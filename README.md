# The Task

This project focuses on analyzing pollution levels (specifically **PM10** and **PM2.5** particulate matter) in both urban and rural environments around London, UK. The analysis compares air quality in a highly urbanised traffic-heavy location (London Marylebone) with a rural site (Rochester Stoke), alongside meteorological data (temperature, wind, and precipitation). The goal is to understand the influence of location and weather on air pollution and the correlation between meteorological factors and pollutant levels.

### Dataset

- **Air Quality Data**: Two datasets, one from an urban traffic site (London Marylebone) and another from a rural background site (Rochester Stoke), provide hourly measurements of PM10, PM2.5, and nitrogen dioxide from January 2018 to February 2021.
- **Weather Data**: Meteorological data collected from Heathrow Airport covers the same time period and includes temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation.

### Project Goals

1. **Compare pollution levels** in urban and rural areas.
2. **Analyse daily trends** in pollution, particularly during different hours of the day.
3. **Correlate meteorological factors** such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation with PM10 and PM2.5 levels.
4. **Investigate the effect of nitrogen dioxide** levels on particulate matter.

### Hypotheses

1. **Urban areas will have higher pollution levels** compared to rural areas due to increased industrial activity and traffic.
2. **Meteorological factors will have a significant impact** on pollution levels:
   - Higher wind speeds and gusts will **disperse pollutants**.
   - Precipitation will **reduce particulate matter** due to rain washout effects.
3. **Nitrogen dioxide levels will positively correlate** with PM10 and PM2.5 pollution due to shared sources such as traffic emissions.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the datasets to remove missing or erroneous values. Organise the data to analyze the daily trends, overall pollution levels, and meteorological influences.
2. **Pollution Level Comparison**:
   - Compare **PM10** and **PM2.5** levels between the urban and rural sites.
   - Analyze hourly trends to identify peak pollution times during the day.
3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Investigate the correlation between **nitrogen dioxide** and particulate matter.
   - Use a heatmap to explore relationships between meteorological factors and air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5).
4. **Visualisation**: Plot daily and hourly trends, and display the correlation between variables using heatmaps.

### Key Findings

- **Urban areas** experience significantly higher PM10 levels compared to rural areas.
- **Daily trends** show pollution peaks around **morning and evening rush hours** in urban areas, while rural areas show less variation throughout the day.
- **Meteorological factors**:
   - **Wind speed** and **gusts** have a **negative correlation** with particulate levels, indicating that higher winds help disperse pollutants.
   - **Precipitation** shows a weak negative correlation, suggesting only minor washout effects in an urban environment.
   - **Nitrogen dioxide** shows a moderate positive correlation with both PM10 and PM2.5, indicating common emission sources (e.g., vehicle traffic).
